# TicTacToe
A brute force tic-tac-toe game

This code is a console based two player tic-tac-toe game.
Each player inputs coordinates based off the cartesian coordinates(rows for x-plane, columns for y-plane).
Once the nested loops detect a win, loss, or tie condition the game will end.
The code can be patched to be more efficient and scalable in the future.
